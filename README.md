# NodeCode

Enable copy / pasting Blender node setups as text.

Imagine for example that you're looking at a tutorial to make a procedural wood
shader.

Without NodeCode, to get the completed material you would have to either:
1. Draw the node setup by hand in Blender, based on the tutorial
2. If the tutorial comes with a `.blend` file, download that and append the
   material to your own file.

With NodeCode, the tutorial can just include a text with the node setup.

You copy the text, paste it in Blender, and voil√†! You have the node setup ready to
go.

The text format is a subset of Python, so you can open NodeCode files in a text
editor, and edit them there.

# TODO
- Extract Python type stubs from Blender
- Publish Python type stubs to PyPI
- Make a Blender add-on that can show NodeCode for any node setup
  - Shaders
  - Geometry
  - Compositing
- Enable the add-on to create a new node setup (or overwrite an existing one?)
  from a NodeCode file
